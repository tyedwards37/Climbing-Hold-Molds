Project: Climbing Hold Molds (and Potential Wall)
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: Make and print 3D models of molds that will allow me to create climbing holds. 

Software: Autodesk Fusion, PrusaSlicer
Material: TPU Filament

Reason: I love rock climbing and thought it would be fun to have climbing holds. I did reserach and learned that printing holds is inefficient due to the amount of infill and the time it would take to print. A better solution is therefore to print a mold to pour a mixture into in order to create the hold. 

Plan: 
        1. Research what makes a good climbing hold.
        2. Design and model a few basic 3D models for the holds in Fusion360.
        3. Cut those shapes out of another model to make the molds.
        4. Slice and print the molds using TPU filament (for its felxibility).
        5. Research and find material to pour into the mold.
        6. Create the first few holds and test them.
        7. Make any adjustments to the overall layout (bolt hole, texture, etc.).
        8. Design more intricate climbing holds and make molds of them.
        9. Repeat the process until satisfied.
Ideas:
        1. Have AI generate hold shapes. 
        2. Create an entire homemade wall.
